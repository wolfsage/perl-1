    [Fixed]

    - On Perls prior to v5.12, CPAN::Meta::Requirements will be installed
      into the 'core' library path to avoid an older version bundled with
      ExtUtils::MakeMaker and installed there taking precedence.

2.122     2012-05-02 17:29:17 America/New_York

    [Fixed]

    - Fix typo in documentation: the exclusion symbol is "!=" rather than
      just "!". The implemenation was correct, just the docs were wrong.
